# Tarvos Design Kit by Exein 

![](res/Tarvos.jpg)

The Tarvos Design Kit is a collection of components and styles for rapid design and prototyping of the Exein products.

The name of the tarvos design system comes from: Tarvos /ˈtɑːrvɒs/, or Saturn XXI, is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by John J. Kavelaars et al. on September 23, 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 4. The name, given in August 2003, is after Tarvos, a deity depicted as a bull god carrying three cranes alongside its back from Gaulish mythology.

## Document Structure
Tarvos document has several artboards as follows:

- **Getting Started**: Instructions on how to use the kit
- **Grid**: Preset artboards with the grid system for responsive web design.
- **UI Patterns Components**: A collection of assets that correspond to the Tarvos Design
- **Website UI Patterns Components**: A collection of assets that

## Usage
### XD Document Component
Use the Link Assets button or the ‘+’ icon within the Assets panel to link the design system to your new file. Once added, you can add components from this file onto other artboards within this same file. Colors, Type Styles, and Components are organized within the Assets panel; within each component there are the variations, pieces and states of each component.

### XD Text Styles
You can access Text Styles by selecting a text box then going to the Assets Panel and selecting the style from list within Character Styles to apply the Carbon type tokens to an element. Text styles are based on the typography that is described on “Elements” page of this document. We use the following fonts: Replica Family and Jet Brains Mono Family.

### XD Components states
Select a component once it’s been placed on the canvas to create your UX UI prototyping or Design.

## Tarvos Grid
As a designer, we always craft and maintain the quality of the work. We provide a major set of breakpoints for you to start with. We should always consider and care how your design works across screen sizes. Ignoring one of the artboards will lead to poor user experiences. We also provide additional Breakpoints for conveying content/layout adjustments. 

### Getting Started 
To get started with your design, copy and paste the artboards to the right into your new document. To view layout go to “View → Show Layout Grid” and the units at “View → Show Square Grid”.
